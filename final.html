			<h3>Understanding Maryland and its largest city</h3>

			<p>Maryland’s Open Data Portal shows the crimes committed in the state of Maryland through different ways going back to 1975. Through examining this data, there were trends of both violent crime and property crime throughout the state. Violent crime numbers experienced a dramatic decrease from 1975 to 2020.

			With Maryland’s crime data, it is important to consider the city of Baltimore as a hub. Baltimore is the most populated city in Maryland.

			“We think about a small jurisdiction, but yet it has a significant rate of violent crime,” Dr. Asha Layne, an associate professor in sociology and anthropology at Morgan State University, said.

			Layne worked for the Baltimore City Police Department as a crime scene investigator from 2006 to 2011. But, looking at the earlier years such as 1995, the crack epidemic had a major impact in predominantly black spaces as relating to crime, Layne said.

			“There was a correlation between historically red lined neighborhoods and the affliction of crime, or factors that contribute to crime, ie, drugs, guns, etc,” Layne said.

			Maryland has faced a lack of resources in certain areas where there’s been a lack of growth economically and socially, Layne said. The lack of resources relates to different policies in effect, such as what was present in 1995 and in 2020.

			“Resources left with that migration of whites in homogeneously black and brown spaces,” Layne said. “As a consequence of that, the actual investment in these neighborhoods suffered.”

			Some of these areas in Baltimore with a lack of investment are where crime spikes because people are acting to make ends meet, Layne said, after seeing this as a crime scene investigator.

			<h3>Violent crime reports over the years</h3>
			<p>LWhen examining the data surrounding violent crimes, it’s important to consider how the numbers are actually being reported. Does a severe assault on Dec. 31 that becomes a death the next day get counted for the year the assault happened or the year that the death happened?
In 2014, the data shows that there was a violent crime rate of 441.3 per 100,000 people. That number increased each of the next three years before it peaked at 507 per 100,000 people in 2017. 
During April of 2015, there was unrest relating to Freddie Gray, an african american, in Baltimore who sustained fatal injuries while in police custody. 
“That led to a lot of people having certain opinions outwardly expressed against the Baltimore City Police Department,” Layne said.

When unrest settled down, so did violent crime. The violent crime rate per 100,000 people steadily declined each year after 2017 while dropping to its lowest since 1975 at 412.2 per 100,000 people in 2020.
The data from Maryland’s Open Data Portal does not go past 2020, which was the year that George Floyd was murdered by a police officer in Minnesota. This further impacted crime across the United States.
“It's not just about what's happening in Baltimore, but also what's resonating with other communities of color, because that death had a ripple effect right across all other factors,” Layne said.

			<h3>Reevaluation and where Maryland stands now</h3>
			<p>After these big events, which Layne called “hot button” topics, police jurisdictions had to reevaluate their practices. 

There was still a problem that communities faced with gang activity. Though Layne, a New Jersey native, said she is unfamiliar with Baltimore gang activity, she saw a connection between homicide rate and gang activity in her home state.

“These were factors that definitely led to also a spike in homicide rates in the tri state area where I'm from, and if you were to think about lack of options for black youth, that could be a contributing factor,” Layne said.

As for the rest of the state of Maryland, crime is a serious topic when people are moving to different parts of Maryland, Layne said. Layne watched The Wire, a television show on the narcotics scene in Baltimore. Through her work in Baltimore, she said there is truth to the show despite it being for entertainment.
Along with hard drugs being distributed in Baltimore, break ins have been a factor as recent as this year. In September of 2024, the Baltimore City Police Department responded to an uptick in car break ins involving smashed car windows in the Gardenville community of Baltimore. 
Pete Moody, the president of the Gardenville Neighborhood Association, told WBAL TV that there were 25 car break ins during a 40 day period in Gardenville in the fall of 2024. Then, more strain was placed on the community by having to take off work to get windows and cars fixed.
Katrina Hays, the Darien Road block captain said there the Gardenville community has faced a lack of police presence in their community which has allowed for more crime lately.
In the restaurant community in Baltimore, there is an uptick in security guards, lighting and video cameras to face violence occurring downtown, The Baltimore Sun reported.
Recent data that The Baltimore Sun discovered says that Baltimore’s homicide rate is down and is on pace for a 12-year low, as reported in November 2024. Maryland and its biggest city are showing signs of decreasing crime trends compared to earlier years.
